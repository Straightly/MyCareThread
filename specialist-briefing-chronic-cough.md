## Differential Diagnosis Considerations

Based on your medical record, the specialist should consider:

### 1. **Post-Infectious Cough**
- Timeline fits (started Oct 2025)
- Can persist 8+ weeks after viral infection
- Usually self-limited

### 2. **Asthma / Cough-Variant Asthma**
- Bronchospasm documented
- Albuterol prescribed
- **Key question:** Does albuterol help? How often do you use it?

### 3. **GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease)**
- Omeprazole started 11/3/2025
- Classic cause of chronic cough
- **Key question:** Has omeprazole helped? Any heartburn/reflux symptoms?

### 4. **Post-Nasal Drip / Upper Airway Cough Syndrome**
- Pollen allergy documented
- Very common cause of chronic cough
- **Key question:** Nasal congestion? Throat clearing? Sensation of mucus in throat?

### 5. **Medication-Induced Cough**
- **Methimazole:** Rare but possible
- **Timeline:** Started 10/15/2025, cough started 10/17/2025 (2 days later)
- **Action:** Discuss with specialist

### 6. **Thyroid-Related**
- Goiter causing tracheal compression (rare)
- Thyroid dysfunction affecting respiratory muscles
- **Action:** Physical exam of thyroid, recent imaging if available

### 7. **Anemia-Related**
- Mild anemia documented (Hgb 12.8)
- Can cause dyspnea, may worsen cough perception
- **Action:** Investigate cause of anemia

### 8. **Elevated Ferritin Workup**
- Could indicate underlying inflammatory/infectious process
- Hematology referral status?

### 9. **Less Likely but Consider:**
- Chronic bronchitis (no smoking history documented)
- Bronchiectasis
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pulmonary embolism (low probability given normal vitals, O2 sat)

**Tests to Consider:**
27. Should we do pulmonary function testing to assess for asthma?
28. Would a chest CT be helpful to rule out structural issues?
29. Should we trial a higher dose of omeprazole or different GERD medication?
30. Should we trial an antihistamine/nasal steroid for post-nasal drip?
31. Is methimazole a possible culprit? Should we discuss with endocrinology?
32. Do we need laryngoscopy to assess vocal cords/upper airway?

### Treatment Plan Questions

**Medication Adjustments:**
33. Should we add an inhaled corticosteroid if asthma is suspected?
34. Should we trial a different bronchodilator?
35. Should we add a nasal steroid spray (e.g., fluticasone)?
36. Should we add an antihistamine (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine)?
37. Should we increase omeprazole to twice daily?

**Monitoring:**
38. What symptoms should prompt urgent follow-up?
39. How long should we trial current/new medications before reassessing?
40. What is the expected timeline for improvement?

**Referrals:**
41. Do I need to see an allergist?
42. Do I need to see a gastroenterologist for GERD workup?

44. What is the status of my hematology referral for elevated ferritin?

### Prognosis & Expectations

45. What is the most likely cause based on my presentation?
46. What percentage of chronic coughs resolve with treatment?
47. How long does treatment typically take to work?
48. What if initial treatments don't work - what's the next step?
